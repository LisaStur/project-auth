# Project Auth

Pair programming project in Technigo bootcamp. We had the asignment to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in. For this project we have built both a backend and a frontend. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started with planning the stucture of the project. We started with building the API, to have a stucture to then design in our frontend. For the backend we used mongoose, restful API and bcrypt-node for authentication. For the frontend we mainly used React and styled components. If we had more time we would have worked more on the error messages, and we would have added more content on our welcome and secret page
