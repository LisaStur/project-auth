# Stargazer

Create or log in to your Stargazer account to get the Star Secret of the Day from Nasa. A Pair programming project in Technigo bootcamp. We had the asignment to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in. For this project we have built both a backend and a frontend. 

## Technology
For the frontend we have used JavaScript in React with React ROuter and Styled Components, and the Nasa API.
The backend is built in NOde.js using Express and Mongoose.
